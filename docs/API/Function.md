# ðŸŒ± Function

In GreenCloud we operate a system that runs small functions repeatedly. These functions are based around containers that are delivered and executed on remote devices. 

A Function can be created using the CLI and is generally not something that is viewed by the end user. The main purpose of the Function is to act as a logical construct to represent the software/code that the software developer has written. 

When a software devleoper asks to initiate a function - they will create a task which will also have a releated Function to execute.
