What we have created with GreenCloud has not been attempted before. As such we have been refining our approach with regards to how we will handle the workload that we will be presented with.

The above diagram represents the fifth iteration of GreenCloud!

What started out as simply getting one computer talking to another across the internet has grown in to a fully fledged scalable system that is capable of performing huge amounts of code execution / tasks on almost any platform!

We have split the documentation in to the main sections of the GreenCloud software suite.

#### API

-   This section documents all of the microservices that we use in GreenCloud and how to call them.

#### CLI

-   Possibly the most powerful tool in GreenCloud - this section documents its functionality and the best steps in how to use it.

#### Guide

-   In this section we go over some common issues and also techniques we have created when working with GreenCloud.
