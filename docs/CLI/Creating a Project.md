# Creating a Project!

Where to start! The CLI is one of the earliest tools that we created with Green Cloud and it really is where a lot of the 'power' lies with Green Cloud and a software developer.

- You will need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for your device as we use it extensively.
- You will also need a valid Green Cloud account (create one here) [Green Cloud - Sign Up](https://app.greencloudcomputing.io/signup)

The rest of the pages in this section will be spent detailing the various niche calls in the CLI and how they work and inter-operate.
