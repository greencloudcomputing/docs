# ðŸŒ± Creating a Function

Once you have created a Project and made sure that you are inside the project directory you can then create a function. Use the following command -

```console
    ./gccli lambda init
```

You will then be asked 2 questions -

1. Then name of the function
2. Choose the language the function will be written in

Green Cloud supports the following languages at the time of writing -

ðŸ”– Available languages:
ðŸ”† GOLANG â†’ go (1.18)
ðŸ”† PYTHON â†’ py (3.7)
ðŸ”† NODEJS â†’ js (16)
ðŸ”† CSHARP â†’ cs (6)
ðŸ”† RUBY â†’ rb (2.7.5)

We will be adding more as GreenCloud grows. To select the languages use the abbreviation. For example if you are going to write a function in GoLang use 'go'.
