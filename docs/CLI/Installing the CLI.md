# üßë‚Äçüíª Installing the CLI !

You can download the CLI from this link -:

[Green Cloud CLI Tool](https://dl.greencloudcomputing.io/gccli)

On Linux and OSX machines you will need to convert the file into a executable. Use the CHMOD command to achieve this -:

```console
    chmod +x gccli-0.5.2-darwin-amd64
```

This tells the operation system that the file is an executable. On a MAC machines, if you get a message like this,

then open the System Settings window (top left Apple icon) and select Security Settings. ( Specific namings may vary due to OS updates / versions ). You should see a screen that is similar to this -:
