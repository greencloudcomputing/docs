# üßë‚Äçüíª Installing the CLI !

You can download the CLI from this link ‚Üí [GreenCloud CLI Tool](https://app.greencloudcomputing.io/downloads)

### Linux and OSX

On Linux and OSX machines you will need to convert the file into a executable. Use the CHMOD command to achieve this :-

```
chmod +x gccli-0.5.2-darwin-amd64
```

This tells the operation system that the file is an executable. On MAC machines, if you get a message like this,

![Unknown Developer](../../img/dev-verified.png)

then open the System Settings window (top left Apple icon) and select Security Settings. (Specific namings may vary due to OS updates / versions). You should see a screen that is similar to this :-

![Unknown Developer](../../img/allowapp.png)

Click the button "Allow Anyway". The computer will ask you to authenticate with your user name or password. You should then be able to access the CLI tool on your machine!

### Windows

On Windows machines you will need to place the gccli.exe file in the windows/system32 folder.

### Running the CLI tool

Running the CLI tool will look as below:-

<cliWindow>

```text {1}

The rest of the pages in this section will be spent detailing the various niche calls in the CLI and how they work and inter-operate.
